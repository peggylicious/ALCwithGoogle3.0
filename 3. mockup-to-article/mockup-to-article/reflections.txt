I started learning how to build websites in December of 2016, when I came across an wwww.edx.org mobile app on a friend's (Wofai) phone.
In May of 2018, I signed up for the Andela udacity Scholarship program. The Andela program has assisted my drive to improve on my skills
by introducing me to an online community of aspiring web developers from all over africa. There we share experiences, network and help each other with the courses problem sets from the Udacity Online School.
Learning how to build websites has been a superb experience for me and I would love to pen a few of my experiences here.
