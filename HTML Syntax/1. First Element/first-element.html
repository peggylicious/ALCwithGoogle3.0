<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph. It is represented using the &lt p &gt tag and it's a block-level element</p>
    <span>This is the span element. It is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.</span>
    <span>(Second span tag)It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a &lt div &gt element, but &lt div &gt is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline element.</span>
